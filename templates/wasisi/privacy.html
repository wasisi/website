<h3><strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</strong></h3>
<p>We collect information, including Personal Information (described above), when you sign up for a user account, participate in online courses, register for a paid certificate, send us email messages and/or participate in our public forums. We also collect certain usage information about student performance and patterns of learning.

<h3><strong>USE FOR PERSONALIZATION AND PEDAGOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS</strong></h3>
<p>Our goal is to provide current and future visitors with the best possible educational experience. To further this goal, we sometimes present different users with different versions of course materials and software. We do this to personalize the experience to the individual learner (assess the learner's level of ability and learning style, and present materials best suited to the learner), to evaluate the effectiveness of our course materials, to improve our understanding of the learning process and to otherwise improve the effectiveness of our offerings. We may publish or otherwise publicize results from this process, but, unless otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy, those publications or public disclosures will not include Personal Information.</p>
</div>

<div class="row col-lg-12">

<p>The Site contains links to websites published by third parties, including other content providers as well as certain service providers, such as those who process payments on behalf of U-study. These other websites are not under our control, and you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the collection and use of your information by such websites, unless we have otherwise indicated in this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to be aware when you are be redirected to a third party website and review the privacy policies of each website you visit and use.</p>

Nonetheless, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure; and therefore, U-study cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
